Imagine that your data is influenced by two seasonality factors. For example, an ice-cream seller expects certain seasonality pattern daily and also weekly. 
The TBATS model is a time series model for series exhibiting multiple seasonalities.
You can control the visual attributes to suit your needs. 

Here is how it works: 
[#LI] Define the required "Date" field (of type "date" or "date/time" ) [/#LI]
[#LI] Define the required "Value" field (numeric ) [/#LI]
[#LI] Select the required seasonalities in "Forecasting settings" [/#LI]
[#LI] Use numerous formatting controls to refine the visual appearance of the plot [/#LI]

R package dependencies (which are auto-installed): zoo, scales, reshape2, ggplot2, plotly, forecast, lubridate, htmlwidgets, XML
Supports R versions: R 3.4.0, R 3.3.3, R 3.3.2, MRO 3.2.2 

Warning: the optimization procedure for TBATS is time consuming. It is recommended only if your data exhibits multiple seasonalities. 
NEW: support for tooltips on hover and selection.
